# Forge Mock

Hello and welcome to the **Forge Mock** project!

This project is designed to help you quickly generate realistic mock data and simulate APIs for testing and development. Whether you're prototyping a new application, running integration tests, or just exploring ideas, our tool aims to make your life easier

### The project is in the active development stage

## Overview

- **Mock Data Generation:** Create customizable, realistic datasets to mimic your application's data needs
- **API Mocking:** Simulate API endpoints to test frontend and backend integrations without relying on live services
- **Active Development:** We're continuously working on improvements and new features. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!

## Features

- **Customizable Schemas:** Define your own data schemas to generate exactly the data you need
- **Simulated API Endpoints:** Easily set up endpoints to return dynamic or static mock data
- **Extensible and Configurable:** Built with flexibility in mind, allowing for easy integration into your development workflow
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Speed up the development process by quickly simulating data and API responses

## Important Notes

- You can use every repository for your needs, all of them issued under MIT license
- The project is in the active development stage right now, so functionality will be added step by step
